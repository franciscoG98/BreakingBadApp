# Breaking Bad App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). And following this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIbJEwbfxr0) shout out for [Luis Cabrera](https://github.com/luismcabrera)

## Available Scripts
My idea of this is to grow the web app and give it more functionalities, like another UI with characters cards, or best episodes, a lot can be done  with this [api](https://breakingbadapi.com/documentation) . For the moment, i am open to suggestions or recommendations. The Author of the tutorial said that i should add error handdlers i'd think that's the next step for me and then deploy it i guess.
